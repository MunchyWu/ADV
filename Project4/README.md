- Before taking any photos, put in a roll of film, Lock the... Take off the Len cap, and ***Pull out the dark slide*** (Jason is doing some cool stuff with that)
* Release the shutter.

  > - Reflect mirror ***FOLD UP***
  > - shutter curtain OPENS
  > - Iris in lens OPENS
  > - Iris in lens CLOSES
  > - shutter curtain CLOSES
  > - Reflect mirror FOLD DOWN? ***NOOO!*** It doesn't
  
- Wind up the shutter again (while winding

## 2.How does my project works

- Every time you want to take a photo, you need to wind the mirror down.
* And that mirror becomes a button, which can create an open/close circuit

## 3.I Wish
+ Hopefully, I can make my chip read if it is an open/closed circuit
* By reading the circuit, and using if/else logic to turn on/off two lights
